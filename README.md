# Recipe-Tracker

A Recipe tracking web page that takes a set of inputs and creates a table with those elements. Each element represents a different part of the recipe and each recipe can be deleted.

This web page was made using the React.js framework along with HTML, CSS and Javascript for the Thinkful Software Engineering Flex course.
